# EGANs-and-GMM-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-Well-Logs
This repository contains code and datasets for anomaly detection in well log data using EGANs and GMMs. It compares both methods for detecting anomalies in geophysical measurements like GR, DT, NPHI, and RHOB, with visualizations and results for improved reservoir management.
